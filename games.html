<h2>Texas Hold 'Em</h2><br> <br>

<b>INITIAL DEAL:</b> 2 cards down to each player, five cards down to the table. <br><br>

<b>PLAY:</b> A round of betting is held after the deal, then three of the table cards are turned up. Another round of betting follows. One more table card is flipped, followed by another round of betting. The last card is flipped, a final round if betting ensues, and finally a showdown in which players make their best hands using any combination of their 2 and the table's 5.<br> <br>
<b>WINNER:</b> High hand<br> <br>

<b>STANDARD VARIATIONS:</b><br> <br>
<i><b>Tahoe:</b></i> 3 cards down instead of 2. No more than 2 hole cards can be used in final hand. <br>
<i><b>Pineapple:</b></i> 3 cards down instead of 2. Each player must discard one before the first 3 table cards are flipped. <br>
<i><b>Crazy Pineapple:</b></i> same as Pineapple, but each player discards AFTER the first 3 table cards are flipped. <br>
<i><b>Super Holdem:</b></i> 3 cards down instead of 2, all of which may be used. <br>
<i><b>Texas League:</b></i> As in Baseball, 3's & 9's are wild (players pay low stake for each common wild card). A common 4 gets each player an extra card.<br>
<i><b>Cool Hand Luke:</b></i> The lowest shared card is wild (As in Lame-Brain Pete).<br>
<i><b>Texas 2-Step:</b></i> After the first 3 common cards are rolled and the betting round is finished, each player may pay the lowest stake for each card he/she wishes to exchange for a new card from the deck. After the next roll and betting round are finished, each player may pay twice the lowest stake for each card he/she wishes to exchange for a new card from the deck. After the last roll and betting round are finished, each player may pay three times the lowest stake for each card he/she wishes to exchange for a new card from the deck. After the last draw, there is a final betting round, then the showdown. If no cards were drawn during the last exchange, there is no extra betting round.<br>
<br>
Identical five-card hands split the pot; the sixth and seventh cards are not used to break ties.<br>

<b>Special No Limit Rules:</b><br><br>

Sometimes during the course of a hand the betting will exceed a players "stake" and the player may not have enough to call a particular bet. The player does not have to forfeit their hand at this point. Should the player wish to continue, they can call the amount that they have in front of them and they will be declared "ALL IN". Any further action will create a side pot of which the "All In" player will have no claim to. The limit of the number of side pots is only limited to the number of participants in a particular hand. The player will have claim to the portion of the pot that they have contributed to.
<br><br>


<h2>Screw Your Neighbor</h2><br><br>

<b>INITAL DEAL:</b> 1 Card down to each player<br><br>


<b>PLAY:</b> Each player starts with an equal number of "lives" (typically four) and each life represents a stake in the pot, which will be collected by the overall winner. Just one card is dealt to each player, and each player may look at their own card. The object is not to be left holding the lowest card. Suits are irrelevant and the cards rank K (high), Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A (low). <br>

Each player has one turn, beginning with the player to dealer's left, continuing clockwise round the table and ending with the dealer. At your turn you may either keep your card or try to exchange it with your left hand neighbour, in the hope of getting a better card. Your neighbour must accept the exchange unless she has a king,queen, or Jack. A king is "invisible" to the game, and that player autmotically goes to the next round. A Queen acts as a reverse, and you trade with the player to your right, and a Jack acts as a stopper, where the exchange does not take place.The dealer, whose turn comes last, can exchange with a card cut from the undealt stock. <br><br>

<B>WINNER:</b> Last Man Standing<br><br>
<h2>Seven Twenty Seven (7/27) <br></h2><br>

<b>INITIAL DEAL:</b> two cards down, one card up to each player <br><br>

<b>PLAY:</b> The object is to get as close to 7 or 27 as possible. As in Blackjack, Aces are worth 1 or 11 and numbers are worth their face value. Face cards, however, are worth half a point (.5). The player to the dealer's left is the lead player, with the lead rotating each round. Each round, each player starting with the lead has the opportunity to take one additional card. The lead then starts a round of betting. This continues until nobody takes an additional card. After a final betting round, players declare high/low/both and hold a showdown. <br><br>

<b>WINNER:</b> Closest to 7 and closest to 27 split the pot. 5-A-A (because Aces are one or eleven, or in this case one and eleven) wins a share of both 7 and 27. If multiple players are equidistant from a target number (like 6 & 8), the player with the lowest count gets the pot share for that target number. If multiple players have the same count, then they each get an equal pot share for that target number. So, for example, if one player has 26 1/2 and two players have 7 and $20 is in the pot, then the 26 1/2 player get $10 and the 7 players each get $5.<br><br>





<h2>Omaha Hold 'Em <br></h2><br>
 
<b>INITIAL DEAL:</b> 4 cards down to each player, five cards down to the table <br><br>

<b>PLAY:</b> Identical to Texas Hold 'Em, but final hands must include exactly 2 of the player's four cards and exactly 3 of the table's five cards. <br><br>
<b>WINNER:</b> High and low hands split, but the low must be 8-high or better (lower) or the high gets it all. Cards speak for themselves. <br><br>

<b>STANDARD VARIATIONS</b>: <br>
<b><i>High-Low Split:</b></i> Players may use all 4 of their cards, splitting them into two groups to form a high hand and a low hand. Cards speak for themselves. As above, but players declare high/low/both. <br>
<b><i>Lincoln:</b></i> The lowest shared card is wild (As in Lame-Brain Pete).<br>
<b><i>Bush League:</b></i> Common cards are dealt in a cross formation. Common cards are exposed one-at-a-time with betting prior to each exposure and after the last exposure. As in Baseball, 3's and 9's are wild. A four exposed gets everyone an extra card. Players may be required to pay the minimum bet for each exposed wild card.<br>
<b><i>Wild Kingdom:</b></i> (Baseball) 3's and 9's are wild. Common wild cards require an additional ante per player. Common 4's get each player an extra card. <br>

<h2>Fan Tan<br></h2><br>

<b>RANKING:</b> Standard ranking, but with ace low. <br><br>

<b>INITIAL DEAL:</b> All the cards are dealt out clockwise, one at a time until all cards have been dealt. <br><br>

<b>PLAY:</b> The player sitting left to the dealer starts out by placing a 7 on the table (it doesn't matter from which suit). If this player doesn't hold a 7, then the turn continues to the next player on the left and so on, until someone can begin the game with a 7. Once the first 7 is on the table, the turns continue in clockwise order. Players discard a card each turn in one of the 11 remaining piles where applicable. The four piles positioned below the center row of 7's, range from 6 down to Ace and the four piles positioned above range from 8 up to King. Players must follow the suit of each pile and must also follow the number order within a suit - meaning if a top card in the lower pile of hearts is 4 of hearts, then a 3 of hearts is the only acceptable card for that pile. A player must pass a turn if no cards can be played, but may not pass a turn if a card can be played. Once a player places a King or an Ace on a pile, the pile is flipped around to indicate that it is completed.<br><br>

<b>RESTRICTIONS:</b> The piles in a suit can only be started with a 7. Hence, players may not play any value above or below 7 within a given suit until a 7 of that suit has been played. <br><br>

<b>STANDARD VARIATIONS:<br></b>

<b><i>House:</b></i> Using Spades as "trump", they can be played anywheres any suit would be. The "trumped" card can then be played on the 7 card. The 7 of spades is not trump<br><br>

<b>WINNER:</b> The first player who has no cards left wins the game. <br><br>



<h2>Liar's Poker <br></h2><br>

<b>PLAY:</b> Each player puts two markers in front of him. Everyone is then dealt two down cards. The first person calls a poker hand. After that, a person must call a hand which beats the previous hand or call the hand. If a person calls the hand, then everyones cards are pooled to determine if the hand exists. If it does, the person who called the game loses one of his markerss and starts the next game, with only one card dealt to him (if he only had one marker, he is out and play begins with the next person in order). Deck is reshuffled after each round. Game ends when only one person has a marker left.<br><br>
<b>WINNER:</b> singleton, pair, two pair, straight, flush<br><br>


<h2>Guts:<br></h2><br>

<b>INTIAL DEAL:</b> 2 Cards Face down<br><br>
<b>PLAY:</b> The dealer deals two cards to each player. If both cards in the player's hand match, then that player has a pair. Otherwise, the hand is called simply by the high card between the two. For example, a King and an eight would be a King-high. Beginning to the left of the dealer, each player decides whether or not they will go "in" or "out". Those players who are "out" have no further stakes in the game unless it is re-dealt. <br>
Of those players who are "in", the one with the best hand collects the pot while the others who called "in" throw into the pot the amount of money that the winner has collected. (Terrill Rule may apply, limiting the damage to .50 per player)<br>

play continues until every one has dealt once, then one final hand where the pot does not carry over<br><br>

In Case of a Tie no one wins, and the "winners" must match the pot<br><br>
<B>WINNER:</B> Best 2 Card Poker Hand (no straights or flushes.<br><br>

<b>STANDARD VARIATIONS:</b><br>
<b><i>Jokers:</b></i> add in Jokers, they are worth nothing, but you must stay in. Pair of Jokers wins over pair of aces<br>
<b><i>Gutter Sluts:</b></i> Hi-Low. Add in Jokers. Low is lowest POKER HAND, NOT SUMMATION. If you declare low and have a Joker, the Joker makes a pair. If you go High and have a Joker, the Joker is worth nothing.<br>
<b><i>3 Card:</b></i> Same as two card, but if you are the only one in the pot you must beat the deck. No Jokers<br>
